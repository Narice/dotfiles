# Vim + Zsh + Tmux config

Created a dotfile folder for my vim configuratin.
You need to have symbolic link of the .vimrc .zshrc .tmux.conf and .vim in you ~/ directory.
You need to have a terminal with 24 bit color support as well as confighuring tmux for 24 bit color.
You can run the vim-layout script (in the tmux folder) to run tmux with vim in the left (85%), and zsh in the right (15%)
you have access to a lot of plugins that i use, linked in the .vim folder. install vundle for a full support of my .vimrc and do a :PluginInstall to install all plugins.

Have fun
